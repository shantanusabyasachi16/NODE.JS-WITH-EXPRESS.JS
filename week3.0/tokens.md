TOKENS-

Tokens in authentication are a critical aspect of modern security frameworks, especially in web and API-based applications. They are used to verify the identity of users and systems, ensuring that only authorized parties can access protected resources

JWT-

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs are commonly used in authentication and authorization mechanisms, particularly in modern web applications and APIs.

SECRET KEY-

Secret key tokens are cryptographic tokens generated and verified using a secret key known only to the issuing and verifying parties.

1.Symmetric Cryptography: Where the same secret key is used for both encryption and decryption.
2.Token-Based Authentication: Where tokens are signed with a secret key to ensure their authenticity.

ENCRYPTION-

Encryption is a method used to protect data by converting it from a readable format (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) using an algorithm and an encryption key. Only those with the appropriate decryption key can revert the ciphertext back to plaintext, ensuring data privacy and security. Encryption is essential for safeguarding sensitive information in various contexts, including communication, storage, and authentication.
